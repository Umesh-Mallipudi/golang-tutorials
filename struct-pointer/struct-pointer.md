Great! Let's walk through a **Go example** that clearly shows:

* Structs created by **value** vs **pointer**
* Their **memory addresses**
* What happens when you modify each
* Whether they **share memory** or not

### 🧪 Full Example: Value vs Pointer Structs with Address & Behavior

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type Person struct {
	Name string
	Age  int
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println("🔹 Struct by Value:")
	p1 := Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 30}
	p2 := p1 // Copy

	fmt.Printf("p1: %+v, address: %p\n", p1, &p1)
	fmt.Printf("p2 (copy): %+v, address: %p\n", p2, &p2)

	// Modify copy
	p2.Age = 99
	fmt.Printf("After modifying p2:\n")
	fmt.Printf("p1: %+v\n", p1) // Should remain unchanged
	fmt.Printf("p2: %+v\n", p2)

	// -----------------------------------------------------

	fmt.Println("\n🔸 Struct by Pointer:")
	p3 := &Person{Name: "Bob", Age: 25}
	p4 := p3 // Same pointer

	fmt.Printf("p3: %+v, address: %p\n", *p3, p3)
	fmt.Printf("p4 (same pointer): %+v, address: %p\n", *p4, p4)

	// Modify via pointer
	p4.Age = 100
	fmt.Printf("After modifying p4:\n")
	fmt.Printf("p3: %+v\n", *p3) // Should reflect the change
	fmt.Printf("p4: %+v\n", *p4)

	// -----------------------------------------------------

	fmt.Println("\n🔁 Mix: Value vs Pointer")
	p5 := Person{Name: "Carol", Age: 40}
	p6 := &p5

	fmt.Printf("p5: %+v, address: %p\n", p5, &p5)
	fmt.Printf("p6 (pointer to p5): %+v, address: %p\n", *p6, p6)

	p6.Age = 60
	fmt.Printf("After modifying via p6:\n")
	fmt.Printf("p5: %+v\n", p5) // Should be updated
	fmt.Printf("p6: %+v\n", *p6)
}
```

### 🧾 Expected Output (with notes):

```
🔹 Struct by Value:
p1: {Name:Alice Age:30}, address: 0xC000014060
p2 (copy): {Name:Alice Age:30}, address: 0xC000014070
After modifying p2:
p1: {Name:Alice Age:30}   ← Unchanged
p2: {Name:Alice Age:99}   ← Modified copy

🔸 Struct by Pointer:
p3: {Name:Bob Age:25}, address: 0xC00000E030
p4 (same pointer): {Name:Bob Age:25}, address: 0xC00000E030
After modifying p4:
p3: {Name:Bob Age:100}   ← Shared memory updated
p4: {Name:Bob Age:100}

🔁 Mix: Value vs Pointer
p5: {Name:Carol Age:40}, address: 0xC000014080
p6 (pointer to p5): {Name:Carol Age:40}, address: 0xC000014080
After modifying via p6:
p5: {Name:Carol Age:60}   ← Same object updated
p6: {Name:Carol Age:60}
```

### 📌 What You Learn:

| Case                     | Address Same? | Data Shared? | Changes Visible? |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| `p1` vs `p2` (value)     | ❌ No          | ❌ No         | ❌ No             |
| `p3` vs `p4` (pointer)   | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Yes        | ✅ Yes            |
| `p5` vs `p6` (value + &) | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Yes        | ✅ Yes            |

### 🧠 Key Takeaways

* **Value structs** create **copies** — they live at different memory addresses.
* **Pointer structs** (`&Person{}` or `new(Person)`) **share memory** — modifying one changes the other.
* Using `&p` with an existing value (`p`) gives you access to modify that value via pointer.

Let me know if you want a version with a slice or nested structs too!
