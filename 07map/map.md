## 🗺️ What is a Map in Go?

A **map** in Go is a built-in data type that associates **keys** with **values**. You can think of it like a dictionary or hash table in other languages.

---

## 🧱 Basic Syntax

```go
var myMap map[string]int
```

This declares a map that has `string` keys and `int` values.

But before using it, you have to **initialize** it:

```go
myMap = make(map[string]int)
```

Or, you can do both in one line:

```go
myMap := make(map[string]int)
```

---

## 🔧 Adding & Updating Elements

```go
myMap["age"] = 25
myMap["score"] = 90
```

If the key already exists, it updates the value.

---

## 📖 Reading Elements

```go
value := myMap["age"]
fmt.Println(value) // Output: 25
```

If the key doesn’t exist, it returns the **zero value** of the value type (`0` for `int`, `""` for `string`, etc.).

---

## ✅ Checking If a Key Exists

```go
value, exists := myMap["age"]
if exists {
    fmt.Println("Value is:", value)
} else {
    fmt.Println("Key not found")
}
```

---

## ❌ Deleting a Key

```go
delete(myMap, "age")
```

---

## 🔁 Iterating Over a Map

```go
for key, value := range myMap {
    fmt.Println(key, value)
}
```

> Note: Map iteration order is **not guaranteed** — it's randomized.

---

## 🧪 Example

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    student := make(map[string]int)
    student["Alice"] = 85
    student["Bob"] = 92

    fmt.Println("Alice's score:", student["Alice"])

    for name, score := range student {
        fmt.Printf("%s scored %d\n", name, score)
    }

    delete(student, "Bob")
    fmt.Println("After deletion:", student)
}
```

## 📚 Go Maps: `make()` vs `new()` – Key Concepts


## 🧠 Why `make()` in Go?

Go is a **statically typed, compiled language** with a strong focus on **performance and memory control**. Unlike Python, Go doesn't automatically allocate memory behind the scenes when you declare a map, slice, or channel. You have to **explicitly initialize** them using `make()`.

Let’s break it down:

---

### 🔍 What `make()` Does

In Go, `make()` is used to **initialize** certain built-in types that need memory to be allocated:

* **Maps**
* **Slices**
* **Channels**

Until you call `make()`, these types exist as `nil`, and trying to use them causes a runtime error.

### 🔹 Why Do We Need `make()` for Maps in Go?

* In Go, **maps are reference types** but must be **initialized before use**.
* Unlike Python (where `my_dict = {}` works out of the box), Go requires you to explicitly allocate memory using `make()`.

```go
m := make(map[string]int) // ✅ Properly initialized map
m["key"] = 1              // Works
```

* If you declare a map without `make()`, it's `nil` and will cause a runtime panic on use:

```go
var m map[string]int
m["key"] = 1 // ❌ panic: assignment to entry in nil map
```

---

### 🔹 Why Doesn’t `new(map[string]int)` Work?

* `new(map[string]int)` returns a **pointer to a nil map**, not a usable map.

```go
m := new(map[string]int)
(*m)["key"] = 1 // ❌ panic: assignment to entry in nil map
```

* Even though `m` is a pointer, the value it points to is still `nil`.

* To make it work, you still need `make()`:

```go
m := new(map[string]int)
*m = make(map[string]int) // ✅ allocate memory
(*m)["key"] = 1           // ✅ works
```

---

### ✅ Summary Table

| Method                      | Description                     | Usable Immediately? |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `make(map[K]V)`             | Creates and initializes a map   | ✅ Yes               |
| `new(map[K]V)`              | Returns pointer to a nil map    | ❌ No                |
| `new(...) + *m = make(...)` | Pointer + manual initialization | ✅ Yes               |

---

> In Go, maps can be initialized in two ways:
>
> * Using `make()` when you want an empty map and will add entries later.
> * Using a **composite literal** when you want to define key-value pairs directly.
>
> Example:
>
> ```go
> m := map[string]int{
>     "apple":  1,
>     "banana": 2,
> }
> ```
